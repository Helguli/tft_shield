TFT LCD Library
================

#Note
This driver depends on 3 other libraries:

1.[Touch screen driver](https://github.com/elechouse/touch "Chip:ads7843")

2.[Adafruit-GFX-library](https://github.com/elechouse/Adafruit-GFX-Library)

3.Arduino SD library(no need to download, release with Arduino IDE)

	This library is test under Arduino 1.5 1r2, and it is just for Arduino DUE.

#Quick Start
1.[Install library](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries "Installing Additional Arduino Libraries") [tft_shield driver](https://github.com/elechouse/tft_shield), [touch screen driver](https://github.com/elechouse/touch) and [Adafruit GFX library](https://github.com/elechouse/Adafruit-GFX-Library).

2.Open examples from Arduino IDE, upload to arduino DUE.
	
	Enjoy it!
